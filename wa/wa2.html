    <h5> My overall goals for this class is to get more confident
        with coding & try to have as much fun with the assignments
        as possible! <h5>
    <h5> I grew up in New Jersey and am excited to graduate in May.
        I love hanging out with my friends & family especially when 
        wine is involved! I'm also obsessed with doggos. </h5>
